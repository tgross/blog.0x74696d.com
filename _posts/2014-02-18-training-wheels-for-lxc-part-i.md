><aside>Welcome <a href="http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2014/12/day-1-docker-in-production-reality-not.html">sysadvent readers!</a> You'll almost certainly note that I never got around to writing a Part II of this post or expanding on other Docker-related topics on this blog. I've been busy working away pretty solidly with not a ton of time for blogging or tweeting. But if you're interested in more DevOps goodness be sure to follow @bridgetkromhout and stay tuned here for new material over the next few months. Thanks for reading!</aside>


Tonight I'm giving a talk on how Docker is really just a wrapper on LXC, and when it might be better to use LXC along with your favorite configuration management tools instead of Docker. [Here](http://0x74696d.com/slides/training-wheels-for-lxc/slides.html) are the slides for my talk.

I'll have a longer blog post and a deep dive into the code for this in the next week or two.

PhillyDevOps is hosting the event, and I'm looking forward to Chris Couples' talk on "DevOps for Small Shops". Thanks to Dave Konopka and Hector Castroy for putting the event together. They regularly recruit great speakers on a range of devops topics, so if that's the sort of thing that interests you join the [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/PhillyDevOps/). Come to a meeting and give a talk or have a beer with me afterwards!
