  <h1>Tracing Optimized Edge-Triggered Systems</h1>
  <section class="byline">March 23, 2024</section>
  <p>Today I want to start by talking about hardware signals and end with an
explanation of why Nomad doesn't implement OpenTelemetry.</p>
<p>The terms edge-triggered and level-triggered come from signal processing for
computer processors. Very roughly, for the CPU to service I/O or other changes
in external state, it needs to receive an interrupt (or &quot;trap&quot;) that tells it to
stop whatever it's currently doing to deal with the outside world. An
edge-triggered interrupt sends the signal and then returns to the previous
state, typically having set a register that the processor picks up on the next
cycle. Whereas a level-triggered interrupt sets a value on the line and holds it
there until the interrupt has been serviced on the next processor cycle.</p>
<img style="margin: 1em" src="/images/20240323/signals.svg" alt="rough plot of level-triggered vs edge-triggered signals">
<p>The same terms get applied to distributed systems. An edge-triggered distributed
system receives discrete events and acts on them, whereas a level-triggered
distributed system monitors some state and acts when that state reaches certain
values.</p>
<p>For example, under this loose definition, writing messages to a queue that get
processed by workers is an edge-triggered system. A system where a
reconciliation loops reads the current cluster state and then updates it is a
level-triggered system. Note for distributed level-triggered systems, the state
is typically <em>shared</em> state from many inputs, as opposed to the signal line for
processor interrupts.</p>
<p>Note that these are much less rigorous definitions than the ones in signal
processing! These are useful <em>models</em> of systems but many real systems will fail
to strictly fall into one model or the other.</p>
<h2 id="cause-and-effect">Cause and Effect</h2>
<p>In distributed tracing, as implemented by projects like OpenTelemetry, we work
with <em>distributed events</em> that get tagged with an ID at their conception. In a
web service, we might create the event at the browser client and add spans at
the load balancer, web server, application server, and database, on both the
request and response. The data model also handles fan-out, because each upstream
service adds its spans to the same event.</p>
<p>Tracing provides a causal path through the whole system, because you can
correlate the actions of all components that acted on a given event. This is an
excellent fit for edge-triggered systems because each origin event results in a single unit of work.</p>
<p>The tracing model falls apart quickly in level-triggered distributed systems
because the &quot;level&quot; is shared state. Multiple independent events can set the
level, so there's not a single origin event. Think of this like a thermostat set
to cool a building down to 20Â°C. If one person starts the oven, and another
person leaves the door open, it doesn't matter to the thermostat which of those
&quot;events&quot; allowed the temperature to get too high. There are multiple causes and
the data model for distributed tracing doesn't allow for this kind of fan-in of
events. You can only create the trace from the point at which the control loop
detected the level.</p>
<h2 id="edge-triggered-scheduling">Edge-Triggered Scheduling</h2>
<p>In Nomad, any change to the cluster state creates one or more &quot;evaluations&quot;,
which are the unit of work for the scheduler for a specific job. The change in
state can be an allocation failing, a user submitting a new job, a periodic job
firing, or any of a <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/blob/main/contributing/architecture-eval-triggers.md">dozen other triggers</a>. Evaluations are
written to Raft and enqueued in an evaluation broker on the leader. Scheduler
workers running across the control plane dequeue evaluations from the broker;
the workers run in parallel but the broker ensures that each job has at most one
evaluation in-flight at a time.</p>
<p>The scheduler workers take a copy-on-write in-memory snapshot of the cluster
state at the moment they receive the evaluation, and reconcile the desired state
with the actual state. They submit the resulting scheduling decisions (&quot;plans&quot;)
to a leader to be serialized and written to state (&quot;applied&quot;). This is largely
the architecture described in the <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/41684.pdf">Omega paper (PDF)</a>, and it's clearly an
edge-triggered system.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> So in theory it should be possible to use distributed
tracing here from the origin of an evaluation all the way through the resulting
plan.</p>
<p>However, suppose that a job has ten running allocations and all of them
fail. Each failure event will result in an evaluation for the job. But if they
fail close together or the scheduler is busy processing other jobs, it's
possible all ten evaluations will be added to the broker before any scheduler
worker can dequeue them. Remember that the scheduler works with a snapshot taken
at the time the evaluation is received (the <em>current</em> state), not a snapshot
somehow taken at the time the evaluation was created. For efficiency, it's safe
to throw out all of the other evaluations that happened between scheduling two
evaluations for a given job. And that's exactly <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/load-shedding-in-the-nomad-eval-broker">what Nomad does</a>.</p>
<p>This sort of load-shedding optimization means evaluations can fan-in to a single
scheduling event. Creating an evaluation effectively sets a dirty bit for its
job, where that bit only means &quot;this job needs reconciling&quot;, and it doesn't
matter how many evaluations set that bit. Just like in a level-triggered system!</p>
<p>From a product development standpoint this gap is a conundrum. Distributed
tracing is a popular idea and we should give users what they ask for, right?<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
But if we implemented distributed tracing in Nomad it would be with traces
intentionally broken between the RPCs that create evaluations and the traces
created for the scheduler. Tracing each evaluation from start to finish would be
misleading, and having misleading traces is arguably worse than having no traces
at all. At least for now, the juice isn't worth the squeeze.</p>

<p>As an aside, Kubernetes is often described casually as though
level-triggered. But based on my own limited work on Kubernetes controllers,
at least some are fairly similar to Nomad as described above, where they're
polling the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/cluster-resources/event-v1/">Events API</a>, and using those events to kick off more complex
state queries.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Although to be honest I've seen shockingly few deployments that haven't
been scaled back due to cost overruns.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
