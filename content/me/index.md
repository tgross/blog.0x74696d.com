I'm Tim Gross. I'm a operations engineer, technical manager, software developer, developer advocate, product developer, and general solver-of-problems-with-duct-tape. I have a proven nose for making software more robust and observable, hunting down technical debt, and reducing systems complexity in organizations of all shapes and sizes.

Once upon a time, I designed and oversaw construction of life safety critical infrastructure: power systems and post-9/11 site hardening for the telecom industry, biosafety laboratories for deadly disease research, and clean room manufacturing and hazardous materials handling facilities for the pharmaceutical industry. But software is eating the world, and I found myself becoming an expert in developing software for estimation and CAD automation, as well as information-rich 3D modeling (also known as Building Information Modeling or BIM). So I turned my skills for designing secure and safe architectural environments into an inspiration to focus on building rock-solid information systems.

Since then my technical roles have revolved around the notion of DevOps. Recently I worked on continuous integration/deployment and security for a machine vision application deployed on IoT devices. For a while I was a product manager at [Joyent](https://www.joyent.com/) where my work was focused on application blueprints for the [Autopilot Pattern](http://autopilotpattern.io) and leading the development of [ContainerPilot](https://www.joyent.com/containerpilot). I developed, wrote about, and talked about projects that demonstrate the best practices for container-native deployments on Joyent's Triton platform.

Prior to that, I managed the operations team and the software infrastructure for [DramaFever](http://www.dramafever.com). We ran a large scale microservices architecture on AWS for millions of users. I built our scrappy team of operations engineers from scratch (as well as our IT team). My team had responsibility over builds and deployments, site reliability engineering, performance monitoring and improvements, and developing our video transcoding and analytics ingest pipelines. The work I led at DramaFever was featured as a case study in the O'Reilly book [*Effective DevOps*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920039846.do), by Jennifer Davis and Ryn Daniels.

When it comes to writing software, I work mostly with Python and Go and have professional experience with C# and AutoLisp. I have training in security design and pen-testing. I've dabbled in C, Erlang, Node.js, and Rust, and have a strong interest in learning more about language internals and low-level systems programming.
