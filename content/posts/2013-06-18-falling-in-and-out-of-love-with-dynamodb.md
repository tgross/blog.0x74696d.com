title: Falling In And Out Of Love with DynamoDB [talk]
slug: falling-in-and-out-of-love-with-dynamodb
---

On Tuesday night I gave a talk on my experiences using Amazon's DynamoDB.  [Here](/slides/falling-in-and-out-of-love-with-dynamodb.html) are the slides for my talk.

PhillyDB and Philly AWS hosted the event, and there were some great lightning talks.  Thanks to Michael Reichner and Aaron Feng for putting this together.  Aaron is trying to get Philly AWS running regularly again, so if you live or work in the Philadelphia area you should definitely join the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/phillyaws) and come to meetings.  And give a talk!
