title: Container-Native Architecture [talk]
slug: container-native-architecture-talk
---

On October 29th I gave a talk on container-native architecture at [ContainerDays NYC](http://dynamicinfradays.org/events/2015-nyc/).

[From the programme:](http://dynamicinfradays.org/events/2015-nyc/programme.html#architecture)

>Moving your application into a container and deploying it to production is a great first step towards taking advantage of containerization. This gets you past "works on my machine", and Docker makes this easy. But the real value of containers &mdash; fast immutable deployments, maximizing resource utilization, and bare-metal performance &mdash; comes from an architecture optimized for containers. This is container-native architecture.

> Tim will explore the story of a real-world large scale production microservices deployment of Docker, and the challenges faced in both design and operations of migrating this kind of multi-faceted application to a container-native architecture.


You can find my slides [here](http://tgross.github.io/talk-containerdays-nyc-2015/#/). I experimented with `reveal.js` for these, so use `<space`> to advance and `s` to get the speaker's notes.

You can watch the talk on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08BuE6xyRnc).
